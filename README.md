Projects from Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

## Navigation
* Define and train a DQN agent to learn to prioritize actions based on received reward

## Continuous Control
* Define and train a virtual robotic arm agent to move and hold its position in a specific point using the DDPG algorithm

## Collaboration and Competition
* Define and train two agents with a modified multi-agent DDPG algorithm to play tennis opposite each other
